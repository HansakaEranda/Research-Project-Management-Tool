# Research-Project-Management-Tool

Final year SLIIT undergraduates have to select a topic for their research project and find a supervisor and a co-supervisor who are interested in the same research field. Students should send a document to get the approval for the project. Panel will be evaluated the research topic and send a feedback for the student groups. Evaluation stages are evaluated by different panels. So, to automate and manage these tasks, we are going to build a system as our 3rd year 1st semester project.

This system is working under 4 main functions to complete the tasks.
•	Staff  Management 
	Including supervisor, co-supervisor and panel member, should be able to login to the page, evaluate selected topics, allocate marks and should be assigned new staff members.
	After a supervisor or a co-supervisor accepts a research group he or she should be assigned to the relevant group.
•	Student Management
	Students should be able to login to the system, choose and submit a topic, search their group to check marks, choose a supervisor and a co-supervisor.
	When the students research topic are approved relevant student should be grouped under the relevant supervisor and co-supervisor.
•	Research Topic Management
	This function allows students to submit their preferred topic, and after the panel approves of it, the topic will be assigned for the group, or if denied the students will have to submit another topic.
	Should display the topics which has been already selected to the supervisor and should allow them to accept or decline the topics.
•	Document Management
	Should allow students to submit the documents and should display the approved group list.
	Should allow Staff to check the documents and allocate marks.
